# Stroke-Prediction-using-Supervised-Learning

• Worked on a dataset containing 12,000+ rows and 20 attributes for stroke prediction and conducted data pre-processing, cleaning, transformation,
and exploratory data analysis using Python.

• Addressed class imbalance through resampling techniques like SMOTE and implemented 8 machine learning algorithms like random forest, logistic regression,
support vector machine, Naive Bayes, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors, linear discriminant analysis and multi-layer perceptron classifier.

• Achieved approximately 93% performance with the random forest classifier across various evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision,
recall, specificity, F1-score, ROC-AUC, and gains chart.

• Successfully tested the random forest classifier against the validation dataset to assess how well the model generalizes to new, unseen data.
